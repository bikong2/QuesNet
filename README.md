# DL Boilerplate

This project provides a good starting point for every deep learning experiment, and free myself from coding for features like configure/save/load a model, resume a training process, testing on each snapshots, etc.

The project is a complete deep hand-written digit recognition example with models written in PyTorch, but its design makes it easy to convert to other frameworks or applications, as models and training parts are seperate from the main setup-and-run logic.
